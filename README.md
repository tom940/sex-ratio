# sex-ratio

Schacht et al (2014) found an inverse relationship between a county's male-to-female sex ratio and its overall crime rate.
The authors interpreted this as evidence that a paucity of marriageable woman could induce men to improve their behavior 
(ie to make themselves more desirable marital partners for women).

However, the observed correlation could simply be an artifact of the incarceration system, as imprisoned men are removed
from the county and placed in a county which has a prison. Counties with high crime rates are expected to therefore display
a lower male-to-female sex ratio, as men have been arrested and removed from the county. Counties with prisons (which tend to
be rural and have lower crime rates) will feature high male-to-female sex ratios, as they possess an abundance of imprisoned 
men.

Here, I build a model to assess whether or not prisoner migration could account for the observed relationship between
county sex ratios and crime rates.
