# sex-ratio

Schacht et al (2014) found an inverse relationship between a county's male-to-female sex ratio and its overall crime rate.
The authors interpreted this as evidence that a paucity of marriageable woman could incude men to improve their behavior.

However, the observed correlation could simply be an artifact of incarceration -- in counties with high crime, more men are
arrested and imprisoned outside of the county, thus reducing the recorded sex ratio of the county.

Here, I build a model to assess whether or not prisoner outmigration could account for the observed relationship between
county sex ratios and crime rates.
